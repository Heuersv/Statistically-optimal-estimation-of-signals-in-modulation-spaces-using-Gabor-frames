# Real data simulation
Two mono WAV files of piano recording: a single-key press and a melody, sample at 44.1 kHz. White gaussian noise is then added to obtain a various signal-to-noise ratio,-10,1,10 and 100. Denoising was then apply using the universal threshold. We present results for the denoising with gabor frames and with the wavelets family db4. The parameters are chosen according to our publication.
