## Statistically-optimal-estimation-of-signals-in-modulation-spaces-using-Gabor-frames

# Real data simulation
Two mono WAV files, a piano recording and a blackbird recording from xenocanto both sampled at 44.1 kHz. White gaussian noise is then added to obtain various signal-to-noise ratios, -10, 1, 10, 30 and 100. Denoising was then applied using the universal threshold. We present results for the denoising with gabor frames using a gauss function as well as level 4 B-splines as window function. The results can be compared to wavelet shrinkage methods using the biorthogonal B-splines of level 4 ('bior4.4'). The parameters are chosen according to our publication.

# Simulation
The python code used for the simulation is also available. /Simulation
